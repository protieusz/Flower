# Detailed Summary

Flower is a heavily modified version of Noraneko42W which has been blessed by darakuneko himself for the mod. Noraneko42 was originally designed by [darakuneko](https://github.com/darakuneko/Noraneko/tree/main/noraneko42w).

A List Of Mods Made To The Original DXF by darakuneko:

-Eliminate the extra 6th columns on each sides.

-A square hole was created in the middle that can accomodate either a 34mm or 25mm trackball powered by PMW3360 sensor.

-Base of the trackball holder with lens cut out is integrated into the top case with integrated 5mm switch plate. Top case sits flush with pcb.

-Full keyboard case was created to house the PCB.

-Created 2 versions of the PCB. Version 1 does not have hot swap and solder switches straight to the pcb which is currently been sponsored. Version 2 has hot swappable Kailh and will not be printed or tested in the future so print at your own risk.

-Flower is powered by RP2040 Core - A which you can get from AE.

-QMK code is borrowed from aki27 bally and modified the matrix to fit my Flower. No suppport will be given since I just copy and paste.

-3DP trackball holder is designed by @ma_po_daisuki and his designs are being sold at [his Booth store](https://ma-po.booth.pm/items/5258743) which cost around $10 cad. Go check it out and support him.

-Or you can use my STL 34mm version that is include on the above.

-Use M2 brass hot inserts 3.2mm diameter and 4mm length for the M2 screws to secure the case. I forgot how long is my M2 screws are but they should be greater than 10mm so estimated around 14.6mm. Play around with and buy multiple M2 lenght screws.
